## Description

- Clickable videos that redirects users to a dedicated page displaying the selected video.

- Since the video returned by the API is of short video type so keeping UX in mind, reel like scrolling and autoplay feature is also added. I call it Rolls ðŸ˜†

- Autoplay is done only when the video is visible in the viewport using intersection observer API.

- Also supports pagination in infinite scroll format for both rolls and video gallery format.

- API calls and states across different pages in done using `react-query`
